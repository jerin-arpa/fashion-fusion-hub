## Project features

Here are some key features of my project:

1. Brand-Based Product Listings:

    * The homepage features an intuitive design with the logos or names of six popular brands: Nike, Adidas, Gucci, Zara, H&M, and Lavis.
    * Users can click on their preferred brand to access the brand-specific product listings.
    * Each brand's product section includes high-quality images, detailed product descriptions, and pricing information.
    * Users have the option to filter or search for specific products within each brand, making it easy to find what they're looking for.
    * This feature enhances the user experience by allowing visitors to explore and discover products from their favorite brands.

2. Private User Routes:

    * After logging in, users can access private routes on the website.
    * These private routes ensure that only authenticated users can access their profile pages and user-specific functionalities.
    * Role-based permissions dictate what actions users can perform on the platform, providing a secure and personalized experience.
    * Users can customize their profiles, including updating personal information and settings.
    * User-specific dashboards display relevant data, orders, and actions tied to their accounts, making the website tailored to individual users.


3. Add to Cart Functionality:

    * On every product page, users see an "Add to Cart" button, allowing them to add items to their virtual shopping cart.
    * Clicking the button dynamically adds the selected product to the cart, providing a visual representation of the user's selections.
    * Users can view their cart at any time, displaying the products they've chosen and their details.
    * This real-time cart management simplifies the shopping process and ensures that users have full control over their selections.


4. Cart Management:

    * Users can review the contents of their shopping cart, which displays selected items and their details.
    * They can easily remove items they no longer wish to purchase from the cart.
    * Users have the option to adjust the quantity of individual items to tailor their orders to their preferences.
    * The cart provides a summary of the total cost and the number of items currently in the cart for transparency and convenience.
    * Users can then decide to proceed to the checkout page to complete their purchase, ensuring a streamlined shopping experience.



5. User Authentication with Firebase:

    * Users access your website and are presented with the option to sign in or create an account.
    * To create an account, users can choose the "Sign up with Google" option, which initiates the Firebase authentication process.
    * Firebase securely handles user registration and stores user profiles and authentication data.
    * Once authenticated, users can customize their profiles, including personal information and preferences.
    * User-specific data, such as order history and preferences, is securely tied to their authenticated account, providing a personalized experience.


6. Mobile Responsiveness:

    * A mobile-friendly design to ensure a seamless experience for users accessing the website on smartphones and tablets.


These detailed descriptions emphasize the importance and functionality of each feature in delivering a user-friendly, secure, and efficient e-commerce website.
